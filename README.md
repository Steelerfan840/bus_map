Title: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: This is an app that tracks a bus along a route using GPS coordinates. It uses a real map and real coordinates. It is coded using Javascript.

Directions: Download all files from the repository. Then upload them to your server, once they are uploaded, load index.html into your browser. Once loaded, click the button at the top of the screen to start the animation.

Future Improvements: In the near future I plan on adding more stops and I would like to change the standard flag to a custom one. I would also like to add multiple buses.
